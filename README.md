# bengaluru-housing-price-prediction
In this project, we will implement a machine learning model using the Bengaluru Housing Prices dataset. The aim of the project is to predict the price of property on the basis of certain features, after learning from the training data. We will see the process of data cleaning, feature engineering, outlier detection; how to build a ML model.
